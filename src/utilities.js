  The API used in the lab (Spoonacular) returns dishes with several types, kept in an array such as

  Most dishes returned by the API have exactly one of thes 3 "known" types.
  Your job is to write a callback that checks whether a given type is known.
  The callback will then be sent to `Array.filter()`, so we keep only knwon types. For example:

  ["brunch", "lunch", "main course"].filter(isKnownTypeCB)  will return ["main course"]

/*
  Optional: once you are done with the whole TW1, 
  if you want to learn more functional programming, you may want to rewrite shoppingList(dishes) 
  The unit tests will help you determine if your code is equivalent with the above.

  Problem: ingredientCB is not a pure function because it has a side effect: it changes the result object. 
  Instead, you can use reduce to produce the result object.

  allIngredients.reduce(amountReducerCB, {}), i.e. use an object as accumulator.
  
  To create new objects in the reducer CB, you can use either spread syntax {...object, other:property}  or Object.assign() 

  shoppingList() then becomes:
  return Object.values(dishes.map(callback1).flat().reduce(amountReducerCB, {}))
  
  And you can even move both callback definitions outside shoppingList() . Creating functions inside functions is more expensive 
  because the new function object is re-created and interpreted every time the enclosing function runs.
